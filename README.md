# financial_data_extraction

This tool is a streamlit based app that uses openai api to extract key financial measures such as company name, stock symbol, revenue, net income etc. from a news article. The news article is typically an article about company's finance reporting.

## UI

This repository contains the code for my Streamlit app that analyzes financial data. You can access the app [here](https://mainpy-xo6ms1hk1xn.streamlit.app/).

**Note:** This is just the UI. This will not give the desired result, as I have not shared the actual API key in github due to security reasons.
